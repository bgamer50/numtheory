# README

The finished version of this project will hopefully be a Python library of Number Theory functions.

## Done:
	1. Basic modular arithmetic functions (a sample)
		* Greatest Common Divisor
		* Multiplicative Inverse Modulo m
		* Coprime Checker
		* Extended Euclidean Algorithm
		* Positive Residue Converter
	2. Advanced Functions
		* Chinese Remainder Theorem Decompose (crt_decompose)
		* Chinese Remainder Theorem Reconstruct (crt_reconstruct)
		* Solve Linear Diophantine Equations
		* Solve Linear Congruence Equations
		* Compute Legendre Symbols

## To-Do:
	1. More Advanced Functions
		* Find φ(n), Τ(n), σ(n) Given Prime Factorizations
		* Find the Order of a Number Mod m
		* Find Primitive Roots Given Prime Factorizations
	2. More Basic Functions
		* Some Functions needed for advanced functions
		* Other Basic Functions
	3. Python Librarification
		* Basic importable library
		* Proper installable library
	4. Really Cool Stuff
		* More CRT fun
		* ???
	5. Documentation
		* Advanced functions (i.e. crt_decompose)
		* Basic functions (basically teaching Elementary Number Theory)
