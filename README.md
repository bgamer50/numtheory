README

The finished version of this project will hopefully be a Python library of Number Theory functions.

Done:
	1. Basic modular arithmetic functions (a sample)
		a. Greatest Common Divisor
		b. Multiplicative Inverse Modulo m
		c. Coprime Checker
		d. Extended Euclidean Algorithm
		e. Positive Residue Converter
	2. Demonstration of Advanced Functions
		a. Chinese Remainder Theorem Decompose (crt_decompose)
		b. Chinese Remainder Theorem Reconstruct (crt_reconstruct)

To-Do:
	1. More Advanced Functions
		a. Solve Linear Diophantine Equations
		b. Solve Linear Congruence Equations
		c. Find φ(n), Τ(n), σ(n) Given Prime Factorizations
		d. Find the Order of a Number Mod m
		e. Find Primitive Roots Given Prime Factorizations
		f. Compute Legendre Symbols
	2. More Basic Functions
		a. Some Functions needed for advanced functions
		b. Other Basic Functions
	3. Python Librarification
		a. Basic importable library
		b. Proper installable library
	4. Really Cool Stuff
		a. More CRT fun
		b. ???
	5. Documentation
		a. Advanced functions (i.e. crt_decompose)
		b. Basic functions (basically teaching Elementary Number Theory)
